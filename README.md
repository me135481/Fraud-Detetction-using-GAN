# Fraud Detection Using GAN
- Developed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework for synthetic design generation.
- Generated high-quality, realistic synthetic data samples to enhance model training.
- Implemented the GAN model using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras for effective data processing.
- Conducted performance evaluations using precision, AUC-ROC, recall, and F1-score to assess model accuracy and robustness.
